# ConwaysWayOfLifeTrippy

This was developed in a Unity and C# programming course within the BA Game Design I am doing.  
The goal was to learn how to implement rule systems into a Unity game, as well as working with Shaders to make it more interesting to the eye.  

## Have a look!

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
